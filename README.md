# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project started at 15/7/2021. It will be constantly updated to record the react code that I have learnt so far. Hopefully, I will try to provide more comment to record my learning

The use of bootstrap is mainly focused on the javascript that I dont know how to implement. For the styles, I will mostly put in a separated file in src/styles/
