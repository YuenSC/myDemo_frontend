# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project started at 15/7/2021. It will be constantly updated to record the react code that I have learnt so far. Hopefully, I will try to provide more comment to record my learning

You can access the website from https://shielded-taiga-85851.herokuapp.com/ using heroku

# Current Page
The home page contains a navbar, a background image, a scroll down button moving up and down, some cards component and a footer

The images page contains an input, the value will send to my backend (just for hide my access key) to search in the unsplash api.
